# Python Snake
> Name seems kind of redundant but this is my rendition of Snake programmed in Python

If you go through my repositories you might find that this is essentially just my AI driven snake game but the AI has been stripped out and replaced by you, the player

It's quite a simple, and classic, game which you shouldn't have much problem getting the hang of and then playing in your downtime
